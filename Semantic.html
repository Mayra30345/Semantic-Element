                                <p> The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It
                                is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
                                domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and working cat, but
                                also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to
                                kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a strong,
                                flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a
                                social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.</p>

                                <p> Cat intelligence refers to a cat’s ability to solve problems, adapt to its environment, learn new behaviors, and
                                communicate its needs. Structurally, a cat’s brain shares similarities with the human brain,[1] containing around 250
                                million neurons in the cerebral cortex, which is responsible for complex processing.[2] Cats display neuroplasticity,
                                allowing their brains to reorganize based on experiences. They have well-developed memory retaining information for a
                                decade or longer. These memories are often intertwined with emotions, allowing cats to recall both positive and negative
                                experiences associated with specific places.[3] While they excel in observational learning and problem-solving, studies
                                conclude that they struggle with understanding cause-and-effect relationships in the same way that humans do.[4][5][6]
                                
                                The study of cat intelligence is mostly focused on domesticated cats. Living in urban environments has exposed them to
                                challenges that require adaptive behaviors, contributing to cognitive development.[7] Selective breeding and genetic
                                changes have further influenced their intelligence.[8][9] Kittens learn essential survival skills by observing their
                                mothers, while adult cats refine their abilities through trial and error.</p>
